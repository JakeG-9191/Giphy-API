Have array for placeholder for themed gifs

Have ajax call that ties into giphy and displays 10 gifs based on search parameters, these should come in as stills and then move to animation on click

create onclick function that changes state of gifs, two states include "still" and "animated"

add search bar that grabs user value, places it into array, ties into ajax call and produces proper function results 

ratings must also be displayed with associated gifs, likely in a seperate child element
