# Giphy-API
This website was inspired by a homework for the DU Coding Bootcamp.

The site provides gifs per the user search, and includes 10 default action movie themes for the user to choose from, or they can enter thier own search paramters, where gifs will be returned based on the search. Note that while the theme of the website is to encourage action movie searches, other searches will still return results.

When the user requests a new result, the previous gifs are overwritten.

The gifs first load as still images per the user search results, though the user can play the gifs by clicking on each one.
